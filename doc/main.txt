@section mainpage_modules What is TORO?

TORO is an optimization approach for constraint-network. It provides a
highly efficient, gradient descent-based error minimization procedure.
Currently (2007), there are not many such efficient methods available
(at least we have not seen them yet...)  There is a 2D and a 3D
version of TORO available.

In 2006, Olson et al. presented a novel approach to solve the
graph-based SLAM problem by applying stochastic gradient descent to
minimize the error introduced by constraints. TORO is an extension of
Olson's algorithm. It applies a tree parameterization of the nodes in
the graph that significantly improves the performance and enables a
robot to cope with arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us
to bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size of the mapped
area and not to the length of the trajectory.

Update 11/2007: We provide a new version of TORO that works also in 3D and
not only in 2D.
